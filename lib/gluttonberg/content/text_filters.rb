    # The text filters module is used to extend Textile in a sneaky way. Within
    # any textual content in the site, users can use custom syntax for inserting
    # additional content. Typically this is used with textile, but will work 
    # inside of any text.

    # The actual filters themselves are implemented as Merb parts. This gives 
    # them access to all the lovely filtering and rendering found in controllers.

    # declaration.
