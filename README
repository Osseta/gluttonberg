BOOTSTRAPPING
The Gluttonberg engine will not run a server by itself. Instead it needs to be
booted within a stubbed out Rails application. Thankfully, this is pretty easy
to do.

Say you have Gluttonberg stored in the following directory:

  ~/Code/gluttonberg

CD into the Code directory and generate a new Rails app:

  $ cd ~/Code
  $ rails new gluttonberg-test

Then inside the new rails app, open the Gemfile and edit it so it requires the
Gluttonberg engine.

  $ mvim gluttonberg-test/Gemfile

The require should look like this - assuming you use the same dirs as me:

  gem 'gluttonberg', :path => '../gluttonberg'


Then boot your Rails app.

  $ cd gluttonberg-test
  $ rails server

Simple as that!
